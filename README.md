# Stephens_FeatureCode

This is the feature code for my feature - backend overhaul, improved functionality, and an improved authentication system. I tried to focus on just the files related to the feature, but the back-end code is very interconnected. Hence, one file often requires another to be legible, and my work was scattered across multiple files. My value judgement effectively boils down to relevance, and I purposefully excluded some code that I made that wasn't directly related to the feature, or whose purpose is easy to ascertain from its function call.

## Auth Stuff

This code can primarily be found in the src/controller files. The schema for the user model used in the database can be found in the src/models.

This part was subject to a code review that required an extensive overhaul of the auth system on my part.
